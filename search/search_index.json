If you showed this to someone in the 15<sup>th</sup> century, you could be accused of witchcraft! Instead of the magic, however, behind all of this is genius engineering by the smart people who designed the Internet protocols over 40 years ago! The DNS protocol plays the key part in the Internet protocols; one could say that without the DNS, the Internet would not exist in its current form.</p> <p>One of the interview questions I use is about the DNS. Unfortunately, over the last 2 years, I have seen the general decline in understanding how DNS works. Sadly, even network engineers and managers struggled to explain it with a sufficient level of detail and without confusion. </p> <p>As such, this is a brief explanation of the DNS in the context of the interview question: \u201cWhat happens in the computer and on the network when a user in a web browser types apple.com.\u201d Note this is simplified as much as possible and does not include any advanced features of the DNS such as DNSSEC.</p> <p>I also don't claim to be the DNS expert; not even close! That title belongs to excellent Ivan Ristic.</p> <p>Refer to the figure below and the numbers in blue in the legend. </p> <p></p> <ol> <li>The name resolving subsystem in your PC receives the command to resolve apple.com to IP address</li> <li>The subsystem looks into the host files - in this scenario, we assume the apple.com is not configured in the host file</li> <li>Then it looks into the cache database - in this scenario, we assume the apple.com is not in the DNS cache</li> <li>The PC sends a DNS query to the DNS server(s) that are configured on the PC (usually via DHCP protocol). We assume this is the router at home. </li> <li>The home router looks into the cache database - in this scenario, we assume the apple.com is not in the DNS cache</li> <li>The home router asks the DNS server which is configured - this is typically the ISP DNS server. As such, the home router acts as a forwarding DNS server.</li> <li>The ISP router looks into the cache database - in this scenario, we assume the apple.com is not in the DNS cache</li> <li>The ISP router is not configured to forward to any other DNS server and thus needs to get to work out what the response should be. The ISP server looks at the request \u201capple.com.\u201d and divides it to THREE domains:<ol> <li>\u201c.\u201d - root stub domain</li> <li>\u201c.com\u201d - Top-Level Domain</li> <li>\u201capple.com\u201d - second level domainThe ISP DNS server will do recursive queries for each of these domains and how out what the authoritative DNS servers are. But wait, how does it obtain the DNS servers for the . domain? Isn\u2019t that so-called Catch 22? Not that fast - the engineers thought about this, and each recursive DNS server is bootstrapped with the list of root DNS servers and their IP addresses. </li> </ol> </li> <li>The ISP server asks the root DNS servers what are the authoritative DNS servers for .com domain</li> <li>The response is received</li> <li>The ISP server asks the TLD DNS servers for .com domain what are the authoritative DNS servers for apple.com domain</li> <li>The response is received</li> <li>The ISP server asks the apple.com DNS servers what the IP address of the apple.com is. This is the same DNS query that the PC sent to the home router! </li> <li>The response is received. The ISP DNS server adds that response to its DNS cache, using the Time To Live it obtained in the response</li> <li>The ISP DNS server sends the response to the home router which saves it to its local DNS cache, using the Time To Live it obtained in the response</li> <li>The response is sent to the PC, which also adds it to its local DNS cache, using the Time To Live it obtained in the response.</li> </ol> <p>Only now can the web browser establish HTTP/TLS/TCP/IP connections to the web servers running apple.com website!</p> <p>All above is demonstrated by using the dig command line tool. The +trace option shows what DNS queries and responses are. </p> <pre><code>dig +trace apple.com.\n\n; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.10.6 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; +trace apple.com.\n;; global options: +cmd\n.           86322   IN  NS  a.root-servers.net.\n.           86322   IN  NS  b.root-servers.net.\n.           86322   IN  NS  c.root-servers.net.\n.           86322   IN  NS  d.root-servers.net.\n.           86322   IN  NS  e.root-servers.net.\n.           86322   IN  NS  f.root-servers.net.\n.           86322   IN  NS  g.root-servers.net.\n.           86322   IN  NS  h.root-servers.net.\n.           86322   IN  NS  i.root-servers.net.\n.           86322   IN  NS  j.root-servers.net.\n.           86322   IN  NS  k.root-servers.net.\n.           86322   IN  NS  l.root-servers.net.\n.           86322   IN  NS  m.root-servers.net.\n.           86322   IN  RRSIG   NS 8 0 518400 20240629170000 20240616160000 5613 .

There might not be any risk of security systems affecting IT systems until the security tools are running on end-user devices, servers and as active elements in the network (Firewall admins will agree with me, they get lots of unwarranted grief from IT teams that \u201cfirewall is slowing things down\u201d). </p> <p>Out of the security tool that have potential impact on IT managed systems are the anti-malware kernel-hooked drivers. As the cyber threat actors improve their attacks, so do capabilities of anti-malware tools. To perform their function efficiently these are allowed privileged access into the deeper levels of the operating systems and applications. That is where the technical, responsibility and incident management issues arise. To resolve these, IT and Security teams must work together, not against each other.</p> <p>Take a security tool that requires a piece of software (agent/service/kernel driver) to run on IT manages systems, be it end user computers or servers. The security team cannot and should not demand that the IT team install the said software on their systems, blindingly trusting the security team that \u201cthis software is safe\u201d.</p> <p>Instead, the IT team should insist on correct justification, performance impact testing. An assessment should be done how these tools, managed by a security team, affect IT team\u2019s Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and recovery Point Objectives (RPOs) contract to between the IT team and the rest of the business. </p> <p>Unfortunately, based on my experience, and the analysis of the biggest IT incident caused by a security company to date, many enterprises even in the regulated industries failed to do just that. </p> <p>You might recall these businesses that, even days after the Crowdstrike distributed faulty channel update <sup>1</sup>  and released a fix a few hours later, were unable to resume normal operations. </p> <p>Take Delta Airlines as an example. While all other US airlines restored their predations within two days of the fix made available, the Delta airline was unable to operate for 5 days. As per Crowdstrike blog post, the blame for not restoring in due time is shared between the Crowdstrike\u2019s IT and Security teams. </p> <p>While I am not advocating for the reduction of Crowdstrike portion of blame, I argue that the failure to resume operations once the fix was available, represents failure of IT and security teams in affected organisations. </p> <p>IT teams\u2019 primary objective is to deliver business value by making sure necessary IT systems are available and performing within agreed parameters. Security teams\u2019 primary objective is to reduce the probability of material impact due to a cyber event. The Crowdstrike was not a cyber event. It was an IT event that was caused by a security vendor. Similar events happen due to Microsoft blunders every year.</p> <p>Inevitably, the lack of preparedness to restore normal operations within agreed RTOs and RPOs tarnishes both IT and Security teams\u2019 reputation in the other business functions executives\u2019 books. </p> <p>The lost trust and reputation are difficult to regain. As an industry <sup>2</sup> we need to learn from this and work smarter.</p> <p>The following are three lessons learned from this era-defining incident:</p> <ul> <li>Focus on testing recovery based on agreed RTO &amp; RPOs. Security teams should insist that IT team perform recovery testing covering scenarios where a security tool makes the operating system non-bootable.</li> <li>CIOs and CISO should talk jointly to the rest of business executives and explain the needs for specialised security tooling but also assurances that the tested recovery is within the agreed parameters (e.g. RTOs and RPOs).</li> <li>Engage with the company\u2019s legal counsel and procurement to review the security vendor\u2019s contracts and identify unfair advantages that vendors have embedded in the contracts regarding the compensations due to their faults in service delivery.</li> </ul> <p>iCloud: Cyber think tank footnote.md</p> <ol> <li> <p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike_incident\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Even through cyber security is not officially recognised as an industry: https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8353/ &amp; https://www.ibisworld.com/united-kingdom/list-of-industries/\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>","tags":["RTO-RPO","cyber incidents"]},{"location":"blog/2024/11/10/2024-09-15-cyber-insights-blog/","title":"2024 09 15 cyber insights blog","text":"","tags":["Cyber Hygiene","Best Practices"]},{"location":"blog/2024/11/10/2024-09-15-cyber-insights-blog/#securing-your-digital-shopfront-is-no-different-to-a-physical-one","title":"Securing your Digital ShopFront is no different to a Physical one","text":"<p>In this edition of the Cyber Insights blog, I want to cover the often-overlooked topic of business cybersecurity external posture, written mainly for business executives.</p> <p>Over the past 12 months, I have had several discussions with business leaders and small startups about the image their organisations are portraying to potential attackers, usually cybercriminals seeking ransom money.</p> <p>When explaining the need for basic cybersecurity hygiene to these business leaders, I usually use an analogy from the physical world: \u201cIn your home, would you install a secure door?
