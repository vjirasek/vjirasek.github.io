There are technical solution on the market that provide off the shelf secure storage.</p> <p>Another issue might be the key management.

Key management systems are available off the shelf to address this.</p> <p>This online system is surely not the only system in the organisation so other applications will need to be looked at as well, if they access credit card data. The worst scenario is to have several repositories of credit card data as this is difficult to secure, and sure expensive. it is much better to consolidate data into one system, segregated, secured with all security controls. You can call it the vault. Credit card data should never leave this vault, only be added to it or deleted.</p> <p>Next, customer agents use the system to service customer calling to the call centre and buy over the phone.

SOX requires logical segregation of access, i.e. developers and testers not having access to production environment.

The total transaction values going through the system on average per day is \u00a310,000,000. The contractual penalties for late payments are 0.5% of the invoice value per day, meaning the value at risk if the system was not operating correctly could reach \u00a350,000 per day.

There might not be any risk of security systems affecting IT systems until the security tools are running on end-user devices, servers and as active elements in the network (Firewall admins will agree with me, they get lots of unwarranted grief from IT teams that \u201cfirewall is slowing things down\u201d). </p> <p>Out of the security tool that have potential impact on IT managed systems are the anti-malware kernel-hooked drivers. As the cyber threat actors improve their attacks, so do capabilities of anti-malware tools. To perform their function efficiently these are allowed privileged access into the deeper levels of the operating systems and applications. That is where the technical, responsibility and incident management issues arise. To resolve these, IT and Security teams must work together, not against each other.</p> <p>Take a security tool that requires a piece of software (agent/service/kernel driver) to run on IT manages systems, be it end user computers or servers. The security team cannot and should not demand that the IT team install the said software on their systems, blindingly trusting the security team that \u201cthis software is safe\u201d.</p> <p>Instead, the IT team should insist on correct justification, performance impact testing.

While all other US airlines restored their predations within two days of the fix made available, the Delta airline was unable to operate for 5 days. As per Crowdstrike blog post, the blame for not restoring in due time is shared between the Crowdstrike\u2019s IT and Security teams. </p> <p>While I am not advocating for the reduction of Crowdstrike portion of blame, I argue that the failure to resume operations once the fix was available, represents failure of IT and security teams in affected organisations. </p> <p>IT teams\u2019 primary objective is to deliver business value by making sure necessary IT systems are available and performing within agreed parameters. Security teams\u2019 primary objective is to reduce the probability of material impact due to a cyber event. The Crowdstrike was not a cyber event.

Security teams should insist that IT team perform recovery testing covering scenarios where a security tool makes the operating system non-bootable.</li> <li>CIOs and CISO should talk jointly to the rest of business executives and explain the needs for specialised security tooling but also assurances that the tested recovery is within the agreed parameters (e.g. RTOs and RPOs).</li> <li>Engage with the company\u2019s legal counsel and procurement to review the security vendor\u2019s contracts and identify unfair advantages that vendors have embedded in the contracts regarding the compensations due to their faults in service delivery.</li> </ul> <p>iCloud: Cyber think tank footnote.md</p> <ol> <li> <p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike_incident\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Even through cyber security is not officially recognised as an industry: https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8353/ &amp; https://www.ibisworld.com/united-kingdom/list-of-industries/\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>","tags":["RTO-RPO","cyber incidents"]},{"location":"blog/2024/11/10/securing-your-digital-shopfront-is-no-different-to-a-physical-one/","title":"Securing your Digital ShopFront is no different to a Physical one","text":"<p>In this edition of the Cyber Insights blog, I want to cover the often-overlooked topic of business cybersecurity external posture, written mainly for business executives.</p> <p>Over the past 12 months, I have had several discussions with business leaders and small startups about the image their organisations are portraying to potential attackers, usually cybercriminals seeking ransom money.</p> <p>When explaining the need for basic cybersecurity hygiene to these business leaders, I usually use an analogy from the physical world: \u201cIn your home, would you install a secure door?

In any case, my offer to the younger generation wanting to break through in cyber security: Connect with me on LinkedIn and send me a message explaining where you would like to be in 1\u20133 years in the cyber security industry. </p>","tags":["Events"]},{"location":"blog/2024/06/14/info-security-europe-in-london-2024-observations/#ai-everywhere","title":"AI \u2018everywhere\u2019","text":"<p>Twelve years ago, it was \u2018The Cloud\u2019. Now it\u2019s Artificial Intelligence everywhere. I get that AI does have its use cases, especially as it\u2019s excellent at spotting patterns, such as in the threat detection. However, the generative AI (the use of Large Language Models) is far from \u2018intelligent\u2019. I certainly don\u2019t need the AI to recommend I put a glue into the cheese to stop it sliding off the pizza. <sup>2</sup> Indeed, relying on Artificial Unintelligence in your critical business decisions is dangerous.  I do believe, however, that the generative AI (Gen AI) can be useful in creating summaries from the content it is given; if it\u2019s carefully trained by experts. A great example was Qualys showing how the Gen AI generates a summary of risks, vulnerabilities and recommended actions for different types of stakeholders. I believe it is a great use case for the Gen AI.  However, I would caution vendors not to overstate the gen AI capabilities and its accuracy. It\u2019s better to be truthful and downplay the capabilities. </p>","tags":["Events"]},{"location":"blog/2024/06/14/info-security-europe-in-london-2024-observations/#vendors-organisations","title":"Vendors &amp; Organisations","text":"<p>Companies I visited or talked to (listed in no particular order):</p>","tags":["Events"]},{"location":"blog/2024/06/14/info-security-europe-in-london-2024-observations/#security-phoenix","title":"Security Phoenix","text":"<p>(disclaimer: I am an investor in this company)-  their stand strategically positioned just next to the Innovation stage ensure good footfall.

Almost anything we do today can be done in a web browser. In businesses, the security of the browser has typically been attempted by hardening, restrictions and patching. However, that does not go far enough. Enter Island Technologies (https://www.island.io) and their service \u201cSecure browser\u201d. I like the full control IT admins can have about screenshot restrictions, secure sharing, remote access to internal applications, and more.  </p>","tags":["Events"]},{"location":"blog/2024/06/14/info-security-europe-in-london-2024-observations/#rapid-7","title":"Rapid 7","text":"<p>I attended a Threat intelligence update by Raj Samani and Christiaan Beek; I attended well run and delivered seminar on threat actors and their techniques. As always, Raj and Christiaan do not disappoint with their engaging delivery. Medium and large organisation should put Rapid7 services on their selection list. </p>","tags":["Events"]},{"location":"blog/2024/06/14/info-security-europe-in-london-2024-observations/#qualys","title":"Qualys","text":"<p>I have been working with Qualys since 2001. It was the first security company to deliver the services from the cloud. Qualys continues to excel in the vulnerability management space - which encompasses asset discovery, external posture assessment, secure configurations, cloud security. Qualys stand at the show was very busy, a good sign indeed. </p>","tags":["Events"]},{"location":"blog/2024/06/14/info-security-europe-in-london-2024-observations/#yubico","title":"YubiCo","text":"<p>The company that has pushed through the hardware security tokens for multifactor authentication is still at the top of their game. I learned that their token release 5.7 now supports up to 100 Passkeys, great improvement from the measly 25 in the Yubikey 5. That said, it is sad that the FIDO alliance dismissed Steve Gibson\u2019s SQRL protocol. If they adopted it, there would be NO limit on the number of Passkeys a hardware token can secure.</p>","tags":["Events"]},{"location":"blog/2024/06/14/info-security-europe-in-london-2024-observations/#withsecure","title":"WithSecure","text":"<p>After visiting this stand towards the end of the first day I was thinking \u2018How could I have missed that memo!\u2019.
