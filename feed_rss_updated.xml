Having attended with low expectations following the 2023 event, I was positively surprised by the quality of the event, vendor stands, and associated event Cyber 100 Club. I already look forward to the InfoSec Europe 2025!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would like to mention the people I met during the show: Raj Samani, Robert Rodger, Justin Coker, Francesco, Alfonso Eusebio, Stephen Khan, Nick Thomas, Rob Demain, Clive Room, Christiaan Beek, Shakeeb Niazi, John Quinn&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://vladimir.jirasek.uk/blog/2024/06/14/info-security-europe-in-london-2024-observations/</link> <pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2025 16:00:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://vladimir.jirasek.uk/feed_rss_updated.xml">Vladimir Jirasek</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://vladimir.jirasek.uk/blog/2024/06/14/info-security-europe-in-london-2024-observations/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Securing your Digital ShopFront is no different to a Physical one</title> <category>Cyber Hygiene</category> <category>Cyber Security</category> <description>&lt;h1&gt;Securing your Digital ShopFront is no different to a Physical one&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Physical gate next to a keyboard&#34; src=&#34;cyber-insights-2024-11-10.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this edition of the Cyber Insights blog, I want to cover the often-overlooked topic of business cybersecurity external posture, written mainly for business executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past 12 months, I have had several discussions with business leaders and small startups about the image their organisations are portraying to potential attackers, usually cybercriminals seeking ransom money.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://vladimir.jirasek.uk/blog/2024/11/10/securing-your-digital-shopfront-is-no-different-to-a-physical-one/</link> <pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2025 16:00:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://vladimir.jirasek.uk/feed_rss_updated.xml">Vladimir Jirasek</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://vladimir.jirasek.uk/blog/2024/11/10/securing-your-digital-shopfront-is-no-different-to-a-physical-one/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Win back lost trust by working smarter!</title> <category>Cyber Security</category> <category>RTO-RPO</category> <category>cyber incidents</category> <description>&lt;h1&gt;Win back lost trust by working smarter!&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a typical enterprise, a division of responsibilities is codified: an IT team runs IT systems and a security team operates security systems. There might not be any risk of security systems affecting IT systems until the security tools are running on end-user devices, servers and as active elements in the network (Firewall admins will agree with me, they get lots of unwarranted grief from IT teams that “firewall is slowing things down”). &lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://vladimir.jirasek.uk/blog/2024/09/06/win-back-lost-trust-by-working-smarter/</link> <pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2025 16:00:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://vladimir.jirasek.uk/feed_rss_updated.xml">Vladimir Jirasek</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://vladimir.jirasek.uk/blog/2024/09/06/win-back-lost-trust-by-working-smarter/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Analysis of the InfoSec CIA triad and proposal for its expansion</title> <category>Awareness</category> <category>Cyber Security</category> <category>Mobile operators</category> <category>Phishing</category> <description>&lt;h1&gt;Analysis of the InfoSec CIA triad and proposal for its expansion&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I told you that what you may have learned about protecting information and information systems is incomplete? Curious? Then read on.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inconsistent and incomplete definitions of essential properties in information security cause confusion within the InfoSec community, create gaps in security controls, and may elevate the costs of incidents. In this article, I analyse the current state of the CIA Triad and its deficiencies. I then propose to standardise the terminology and expand the CIA Triad by introducing two additional requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://vladimir.jirasek.uk/blog/2024/08/25/analysis-of-the-infosec-cia-triad-and-proposal-for-its-expansion/</link> <pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2025 16:00:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://vladimir.jirasek.uk/feed_rss_updated.xml">Vladimir Jirasek</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://vladimir.jirasek.uk/blog/2024/08/25/analysis-of-the-infosec-cia-triad-and-proposal-for-its-expansion/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Clicked on a phishing link!</title> <category>Awareness</category> <category>Cyber Security</category> <category>Mobile operators</category> <category>Phishing</category> <description>&lt;h1&gt;Clicked on a phishing link!&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, I received the below text message saying that the payment for my EE bill did not go through which instantly triggered an anxiety emotion: “Why was the payment declined?

Now there is clear business case for implementing these well known best practices and organisation will need to allocate budgets (CAPEX and OPEX) to run programmes to be and stay compliant. PCI DSS will not go away, it is likely to address more security controls in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://vladimir.jirasek.uk/blog/2023/01/01/pci-dss---top-3-issues/</link> <pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2025 16:00:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://vladimir.jirasek.uk/feed_rss_updated.xml">Vladimir Jirasek</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://vladimir.jirasek.uk/blog/2023/01/01/pci-dss---top-3-issues/</guid> </item> </channel></rss>
